Number Guesser
Description

Number Guesser is a simple Python game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides hints ("Too high" or "Too low") and gives the player 7 lives (chances) to guess the correct number.
How to Play

    Run the program.
    You will be prompted to guess a number between 1 and 100.
    After each guess:
        If your guess is correct, the game congratulates you, and the program ends.
        If your guess is too high or too low, you lose a life, and the game gives you a hint.
    The game ends when:
        You guess the correct number, or
        You run out of lives.
